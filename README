To Tests:
- strafe vs point turn
- test that we can see both cards when looking straight down corridor
- changing his findSquares() function

To Writes:
- write sub class of RobotPose for camera stuff
- write strafeTo() function -  PID controller for this too
- write updateSquares() - take new image and process it into usable data

Assignment Algorithm:
1. find the two closest pair of cards
2. compare the areas of the colors (one or both?)
3. move toward smaller squares (or where there is no square?)
